# MLP_RBF_PNN_in_Datasets: [200~To implement Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Radial Basis Function (RBF) networks, and Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNN) on datasets such as flame, banana, aggregation, iris, and wine, you first need to prepare the data appropriately for training the models. Then, train the MLP, RBF, and PNN models on these datasets and compare their performance based on accuracy and the time required for training and prediction.
